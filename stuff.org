* Sections: use of motion
** T2000-low tones
*** Vertical motion in left or right two columns
*** Need: threshold? Or trigger envelope by y-velocity?
** T2001-dummy wait for solo
** T2010-stephen solo
*** Count # of points with mag > a threshold
*** Wild sweeps: move whole body
*** Not sure yet how to do subtler modulation
**** Maybe hands only, on the sides of the window?
*** Two point kmeans clustering
**** When moving a hand slowly, the clusters are located close together
**** When moving the whole body, one cluster goes up and the other cluster goes down
** T2020-plus Ilana
*** Same movement vocabulary
*** Transition: centroid goes up into top row?
*** (That's tricky -- need to move hand while keeping the body still)
** T2030-energy-exch
** T2040-ensemble
** T2050-Ilana to floor
** T2060-Fast ensemble
** T2070-Slow down
** T2080-Ilana up
** T2090-Ilana solo
** T2100-Duet
