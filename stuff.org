* Sections: use of motion [12/12]
** DONE T2000-low tones
*** Vertical motion in left or right two columns
*** Need: threshold? Or trigger envelope by y-velocity?
** DONE T2001-dummy wait for solo
** DONE T2010-stephen solo
*** Count # of points with mag > a threshold
*** Wild sweeps: move whole body
*** Not sure yet how to do subtler modulation
**** Maybe hands only, on the sides of the window?
*** Two point kmeans clustering
**** When moving a hand slowly, the clusters are located close together
**** When moving the whole body, one cluster goes up and the other cluster goes down
** DONE T2020-plus Ilana
*** Same movement vocabulary
*** Transition: centroid goes up into top row?
*** (That's tricky -- need to move hand while keeping the body still -- which makes it a good trigger!)
** DONE T2030-energy-exch
*** Sweep left and right for "throws"
** DONE T2040-ensemble
*** Bursts of activity from magnitude (should slow quickly when I slow)
*** Track left and right magnitude
    Left = burst in \thr
    Right = burst in \fastnotes
** DONE T2050-Ilana to floor
*** Raise arm
*** New note for motion -- tough, want to keep movement slow
*** Pipe some motion control into rotSynth
** DONE T2060-Fast ensemble
*** Suddenly move fast
*** DONE NEEDS TO BE MUCH LOUDER
** DONE T2070-Slow down
*** Move centroid into lowest third
** DONE T2080-Ilana up
*** Raise arm
*** DONE Sweep up should play 1 note
*** DONE mod_lev is wrong
** DONE T2090-Ilana solo
*** Little bit too sensitive
*** Stop? How to measure that? (Overall magnitude drops I guess)
*** Move a little to start a bell gesture: Schmidt trigger with decay
*** POSTPONED Visual indicator when Schmidt trigger resets?
** DONE T2100-Duet
*** DONE Control chord dynamics with y and/or x position
**** Video part is setting the parameter, but I don't hear any effect
*** DONE Run chord process under its own power during fadeout
*** DONE Trigger chord: Stay below a point for awhile, then rise for awhile
*** DONE Fade out? (Maybe walk away from the machine)
**** DONE Reset master level when resuming play
**** DONE Event trigger fired but the mixer GUI didn't change ???
* *Lighting matters* - everything is more sensitive when it's bright
* Bugs [2013-01-24 Thu]
** DONE Wild gesture doesn't always fire
** DONE T2060 is still way too quiet
** TODO T2060 was hard to trigger
** DONE Final section trigger is very very very sensitive
** DONE Did I actually hear bellfx?
* Bugs [2013-01-26 Sat]
** TODO Why does the duet melody get stuck on B-C#?
** DONE ERROR: Qt: You can not use this Qt functionality in the current thread. Try scheduling on AppClock instead.
* Bugs [2013-01-30 Wed]
** TODO 2070 is too loud, not a smooth transition
** DONE Duet is still not triggering chords right
* TODO Write performance notes (what to do in each section)
