* Sections: use of motion [5/12]
** DONE T2000-low tones
*** Vertical motion in left or right two columns
*** Need: threshold? Or trigger envelope by y-velocity?
** DONE T2001-dummy wait for solo
** DONE T2010-stephen solo
*** Count # of points with mag > a threshold
*** Wild sweeps: move whole body
*** Not sure yet how to do subtler modulation
**** Maybe hands only, on the sides of the window?
*** Two point kmeans clustering
**** When moving a hand slowly, the clusters are located close together
**** When moving the whole body, one cluster goes up and the other cluster goes down
** DONE T2020-plus Ilana
*** Same movement vocabulary
*** Transition: centroid goes up into top row?
*** (That's tricky -- need to move hand while keeping the body still -- which makes it a good trigger!)
** DONE T2030-energy-exch
*** Sweep left and right for "throws"
** TODO T2040-ensemble
*** Bursts of activity from magnitude (should slow quickly when I slow)
*** Track left and right magnitude
    Left = burst in \thr
    Right = burst in \fastnotes
** TODO T2050-Ilana to floor
*** Raise arm
*** New note for motion?
** TODO T2060-Fast ensemble
*** Suddenly move fast
** TODO T2070-Slow down
*** Track speed; when it goes consistently below a threshold, go into this section?
** TODO T2080-Ilana up
*** Raise arm
** TODO T2090-Ilana solo
*** Stop? How to measure that? (Overall magnitude drops I guess)
** TODO T2100-Duet
